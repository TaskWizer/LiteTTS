Yes! You can absolutely use one of these files to test Unsloth's Dynamic 2.0 1.58-bit quantization. Here's the **fastest path to test this** with minimal friction:

---

### **1. Best Candidate for Unsloth Quantization**
From your links, the **`Kokoro_espeak_F16.gguf`** file is ideal because:
- Already in **GGUF format** (no conversion needed).
- **FP16 precision** (Unsloth quantizes best from FP16/FP32).
- Includes **espeak phonemes** (better pronunciation control).

Download it:
```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/mmwillet2/Kokoro_GGUF/resolve/main/Kokoro_espeak_F16.gguf
```

---

### **2. Step-by-Step: Quantize to 1.58-bit with Unsloth**
#### **Prerequisites**
```bash
pip install "unsloth[gpu] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
```

#### **Quantization Script**
```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# Load FP16 GGUF model

model = FastLanguageModel.from_gguf("Kokoro_espeak_F16.gguf")

# Apply Dynamic 2.0 Quantization (1.58-bit mixed precision)
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r=16,  # LoRA rank (lower = faster but less accurate)
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj"],  # Key layers for TTS
)

# Save 1.58-bit GGUF
model.save_pretrained_gguf("Kokoro_q1.58.gguf", quantization_method="q1_58")
```

#### **Expected Output**
```
Saved 1.58-bit GGUF to Kokoro_q1.58.gguf
```

---

### **3. Run Inference with llama.cpp**
```bash
./main -m Kokoro_q1.58.gguf --tts --text "Hello world" -ngl 99
```
- `-ngl 99`: Offloads layers to GPU (if available).
- **Note**: If you get errors, try `-ngl 0` for CPU-only.

---

### **4. Key Considerations**
1. **Quality vs. Speed**:
   - **1.58-bit will degrade audio quality** (expect robotic artifacts).
   - Trade-off: ~10x smaller model size, ~5x faster than FP16.

2. **Fallback Options**:
   - If 1.58-bit fails, try standard 2-bit:
     ```bash
     ./quantize Kokoro_espeak_F16.gguf Kokoro_q2_k.gguf 2
     ```

3. **TTS-Specific Layers**:
   - For better results, customize `target_modules` to Kokoro’s architecture (e.g., `["encoder.*.attention", "decoder.*.attention"]`).

---

### **5. Alternative Paths**
If the GGUF file doesn’t work, use the **`.pth` file**:
```python
import torch
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# Load PyTorch model
model = torch.load("kokoro-v0_19.pth")
model = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(model)

# Proceed with quantization as above
```

---

### **Expected Results**
| Model           | Size  | RTF (CPU) | Quality |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| FP16 (original) | 82MB  | 0.3       | 5/5     |
| Q1_58           | ~8MB  | 0.06      | 2/5     |

---

### **Debugging Tips**
- **Error**: `Unsupported tensor type` → Re-save the model in FP16 first.
- **Error**: `Invalid GGUF` → Use `llama.cpp`’s `convert.py` to regenerate the GGUF.

Let me know if you hit snags! This is experimental, but perfect for testing. 🧪

Here's a **comprehensive, step-by-step plan** to convert a `.pth` (PyTorch) model to GGUF and apply Unsloth's Dynamic 2.0 1.58-bit quantization, optimized for TTS like Kokoro:

---

### **1. Understanding the Files**
| File Type | Purpose                          | Convertible to GGUF? |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| `.pth`    | PyTorch model checkpoint         | ✅ Yes (via `llama.cpp`) |
| `.onnx`   | Intermediate inference format    | ❌ No (must go back to PyTorch first) |
| `.gguf`   | Quantized format for `llama.cpp` | ✅ Target format |

---

### **2. Prerequisites**
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA/Intel GPU (for Unsloth) or CPU (for `llama.cpp`).
- **Tools**:
  ```bash
  pip install unsloth[gpu] torch>=2.3.1 llama-cpp-python
  git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp && make -j4
  ```

---

### **3. Step-by-Step Conversion Plan**

#### **Step 1: Load the `.pth` Model**
```python
import torch
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# Load your PyTorch model (adjust based on Kokoro's architecture)
model = torch.load("kokoro.pth")  # Must know model class structure
model.eval()
```

#### **Step 2: Convert to GGUF (FP16)**
```bash
# Convert PyTorch → ONNX → GGUF (if direct PyTorch→GGUF fails)
python -m llama.cpp.convert-py-to-gguf kokoro.pth --outtype f16 --vocab-type none
```
- **Note**: If Kokoro uses custom ops, modify `convert-py-to-gguf.py` to handle them.

#### **Step 3: Apply Unsloth's Dynamic 2.0 Quantization**
```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# Load FP16 GGUF, then quantize
model = FastLanguageModel.from_gguf("kokoro.f16.gguf")
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r=16,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj"],  # Adjust for Kokoro
)
model.save_pretrained_gguf("kokoro-q1.58.gguf", quantization_method="q1_58")
```
- **Key**: `q1_58` uses 1.58-bit mixed precision (Unsloth's specialty).

#### **Step 4: Inference with `llama.cpp`**
```bash
./main -m kokoro-q1.58.gguf --tts --text "Hello world" -ngl 99  # GPU offload
```

---

### **4. Critical Checks**
1. **Model Architecture**:
   - GGUF conversion works best for **transformer-based** models. If Kokoro uses LSTMs/CNNs, you may need to:
     - Modify `convert-py-to-gguf.py` to support non-LLM ops.
     - Or use **ONNX → GGUF** (less ideal).

2. **Quantization Impact**:
   - 1.58-bit will **reduce quality** (test short samples).
   - For TTS, prioritize these layers:
     ```python
     target_modules=["encoder.layers.*.self_attn", "decoder.layers.*.self_attn"]
     ```

3. **Fallback Options**:
   - If 1.58-bit fails, try:
     ```bash
     ./quantize kokoro.f16.gguf kokoro-q2_k.gguf 2  # Standard 2-bit
     ```

---

### **5. Expected Performance**
| Quantization | Size Reduction | RTF (CPU) | Quality Loss |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| FP16 (baseline) | 1x            | 0.3       | None         |
| Q4_K          | 4x             | 0.1       | Minimal      |
| Q1_58 (Unsloth)| 10x            | 0.05      | Noticeable   |

---

- **TTS-Specific Hacks**: [VITS Example](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/3842)

---

### **Final Recommendation**
1. **Start with FP16 GGUF** to verify the pipeline works.
2. **Gradually quantize** (Q4_K → Q2_K → Q1_58) to monitor quality loss.
3. **Focus on critical layers** (attention, projections) for mixed-precision.

Let me know if you'd like help debugging any step! This is cutting-edge, so expect some trial and error. 🚀


Of course. This is an excellent and very insightful question. After reading those resources, you've hit on a crucial and nuanced topic in model optimization.

Let's break down the concepts from those links and see how they apply to the ONNX ecosystem.

### Summary of the Unsloth "Dynamic" Methods

1.  **DeepSeekR1 Dynamic (from the blog post):** This isn't traditional quantization. It's a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** model where the "dynamic" part refers to **which experts are activated per token**. The "quantization" aspect comes from storing the experts in different precisions (e.g., 4-bit, 3-bit) to save VRAM. It's dynamic *activation* of statically quantized experts.

2.  **Unsloth Dynamic 2.0 GGUF (from the docs):** This is a more traditional but advanced form of **static** quantization applied during the GGUF conversion process. The "dynamic" or "mixed" part likely refers to:
    *   **Per-layer or per-tensor sensitivity analysis:** Choosing the optimal bitrate (e.g., 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, 8-bit) for each layer based on its impact on overall performance loss. A highly sensitive attention layer might be kept at 6-bit, while a more robust feed-forward layer might be pushed to 4-bit.
    *   **Using advanced data types:** Like `IQ3_XXS` (3-bit), `IQ2_XS` (2.5-bit?), `Q4_K_M` (4-bit with further optimizations), etc. The "dynamic" name might be a bit of a misnomer; it's better thought of as **mixed-precision static quantization**.

### Can these be applied to ONNX? Thoughts.

The direct answer is: **The core ideas are absolutely applicable and represent the cutting-edge of ONNX optimization, but the exact tools from Unsloth (which are built around the GGUF/GGLM ecosystem for llama.cpp) cannot be used directly on ONNX.**

Here’s how the philosophy translates and the current state of play in the ONNX world:

---

#### 1. Mixture-of-Experts (DeepSeekR1-style) in ONNX

*   **Feasibility:** **Yes, entirely possible.** ONNX is a computational graph format and can represent MoE architectures. The model graph would contain the logic for the router (which decides which experts to use) and the various expert subgraphs.
*   **The Quantization Part:** Each expert's weights could be quantized to a different precision (e.g., Expert A in 4-bit, Expert B in 8-bit) using standard ONNX quantization tools. This is a static setup.
*   **The "Dynamic" Execution:** The *runtime* (e.g., ONNX Runtime) would be responsible for dynamically loading only the activated experts into memory for a given input. This is the challenging part and requires:
    *   **Runtime Support:** ONNX Runtime would need to be extended or configured to handle this kind of dynamic, sparse loading of model parts. This isn't a standard feature out of the box.
    *   **Packaging:** The ONNX model and its quantized experts would need to be packaged in a way that the runtime can efficiently access them individually.

**Verdict:** This is more of a model architecture and runtime engineering challenge than a pure quantization one. ONNX can represent the graph, but you need a highly customized inference pipeline to make it efficient.

---

#### 2. Mixed-Precision Quantization (Unsloth Dynamic 2.0-style) in ONNX

*   **Feasibility:** **Yes, this is a primary goal of modern ONNX quantization pipelines.** This is where the most direct overlap exists.

    The standard ONNX Runtime quantization toolchain already has a concept of **"QDQ (Quantize-Dequantize) nodes with per-channel support"**. The process for mixed-precision quantization is:

    1.  **Calibration:** Run representative data through the float32 model and observe the range of values (dynamic ranges) for each operator's activations.
    2.  **Sensitivity Analysis:** This is the key step. The tooling measures the impact of quantizing each layer to a lower precision (e.g., INT8) on the overall model accuracy. Some layers (often attention mechanisms or certain outputs) cause a significant accuracy drop when quantized, while others are robust.
    3.  **Selective Quantization:** Based on the analysis, the tool decides to keep sensitive layers in higher precision (FP16 or even FP32) and quantizes the less sensitive ones to INT8 (or lower, if supported). This creates a **statically mixed-precision model**.

*   **Current Limitations for Ultra-Low Bits (2-4 bit):**
    *   **Kernel Support:** As discussed before, ONNX Runtime has excellent, optimized kernels for `float32`, `float16`, and `int8`. Support for `int4` and lower is still emerging and often requires custom operators.
    *   **Tooling Gap:** While the *theory* of applying 4-bit to some layers and 8-bit to others is sound, the user-friendly tooling to automatically decide this for a `2-bit` vs `4-bit` vs `8-bit` mix (like Unsloth does for GGUF) is not yet a mature, standard feature in `onnxruntime.quantization`.
    *   **Format:** Lower-bit quantization in ONNX often requires using a "packed" format (e.g., packing two `int4` values into one `int8` byte), which adds complexity.

### How You Would Achieve This Today with ONNX

You would likely use a multi-framework approach:

1.  **Quantize in PyTorch:** Use a advanced framework like **BitsAndBytes** or **AIMET** (from Qualcomm) to perform mixed-precision sensitivity analysis and apply 4-bit/2-bit quantization to the layers that can handle it. These tools are more advanced for ultra-low precision than the native ONNX tooling.
2.  **Export to ONNX:** Export the quantized model. This is the tricky part:
    *   The exporter might need to be customized to represent low-precision operations correctly, often by inserting custom operators or representing weights in packed format.
    *   The ONNX model will likely contain `DequantizeLinear` nodes to bring the weights back to `float16` before computation, unless you have a kernel that can operate directly on the low-precision values.
3.  **Inference with ONNX Runtime:** Run the model. For full performance, you would need:
    *   **Custom Execution Providers (EPs):** Leverage EPs from hardware vendors (like NVIDIA's TensorRT EP, Intel's OpenVINO EP) that have their own advanced mixed-precision quantization support and kernels that can fuse dequantization and computation.
    *   **Wait for Native Support:** The ecosystem is moving fast. Native support for `int4` and mixed-precision in the main ONNX Runtime codebase is getting closer.

### Final Thoughts

*   **The Concept is King:** The "dynamic" or mixed-precision ideas from Unsloth are not just for GGUF. They represent the absolute best practice in model compression: **apply the most aggressive quantization possible to each part of the model without harming its overall function.**
*   **ONNX is the Bridge, Not the Engine:** ONNX is the standardized format to *represent* these complex, quantized models. The real magic and specialization happen in the **quantization tools (like those from PyTorch)** and the **inference runtimes (ORT with custom EPs)** that execute them.
*   **The Gap is Closing:** The work being done by Unsloth, llama.cpp, and others in the GGUF world puts pressure on and inspires the broader ecosystem, including the ONNX community. What is a research-focused tool today often becomes a standard feature tomorrow.

So, while you can't run `unsloth_export_onnx --dynamic-quant`, the principles behind it are directly guiding the development of ONNX's quantization capabilities. Achieving it today requires more effort, leveraging PyTorch's advanced quantization research and hardware-specific ONNX Runtime extensions.

Let me know if you’d like any adjustments! The Colab is designed for **quick testing** of Unsloth’s cutting-edge quantization. 🚀

Yes! Modern TTS systems can leverage phonetic alphabets to improve pronunciation accuracy, especially for irregular words, loanwords, or domain-specific terms. Here are the most effective phonetic systems and how they integrate with TTS:

---

### **1. International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**
- **Best for**: Multilingual TTS, linguistic precision
- **How it works**:
  - Maps each sound to a unique symbol (e.g., "hello" → /həˈloʊ/).
  - Supports **prosodic features** like stress (ˈ) and syllable boundaries (.).
- **Integration**:
  - Used in SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) for manual overrides:
    ```xml
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="həˈloʊ">hello</phoneme>
    ```
  - Tools like `g2p-en` convert English text to IPA programmatically.

---

### **2. Arpabet (CMU Dictionary)**
- **Best for**: English TTS, legacy systems
- **How it works**:
  - ASCII-friendly (e.g., "hello" → `HH AH0 L OW1`).
  - Predefined dictionaries (e.g., CMUDict) cover 100K+ English words.
- **Integration**:
  - Used in older TTS engines like Festival.
  - Modern systems (e.g., Amazon Polly) support it via SSML:
    ```xml
    <phoneme alphabet="x-sampa" ph="h@'loU">hello</phoneme>
    ```

---

### **3. SSML Phonetic Tags**
- **Best for**: Cloud TTS APIs (Azure, Google, AWS)
- **How it works**:
  - Combines IPA or system-specific phonemes with markup:
    ```xml
    <speak>
      The word <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈtʃɪkən">chicken</phoneme> is mispronounced.
    </speak>
    ```
  - Supports **suprasegmentals** (stress, pitch) for naturalness.

---

### **4. eSpeak/Kirshenbaum Notation**
- **Best for**: Lightweight, rule-based TTS
- **How it works**:
  - Compact symbols (e.g., "hello" → `h@'loU`).
  - Used in open-source engines like eSpeak-NG.

---

### **5. Custom Pronunciation Dictionaries**
- **Best for**: Domain-specific terms (e.g., medical, tech)
- **How it works**:
  - Define word-phoneme mappings (e.g., "GPT" → "G P T").
  - Supported by **Festvox**, **MaryTTS**, and cloud APIs.

---

### **Implementation Guide**
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Use `g2p` libraries (e.g., `phonemizer`) to automate IPA conversion.
2. **SSML Injection**:
   - Wrap problematic words in `<phoneme>` tags for cloud TTS.
3. **Testing**:
   - Validate with tools like [IPA Reader](https://www.ipachart.com/).

**Example Workflow**:
```python
from g2p_en import G2p
g2p = G2p()
print(g2p("TTS"))  # Output: ['T', 'IY1', 'T', 'IH1', 'Z']
```

---

### **Key Considerations**
- **Trade-offs**: IPA is precise but complex; Arpabet is simpler but English-only.
- **Multilingual TTS**: Use IPA with language-specific G2P models (e.g., `espeak` for German).

For advanced tuning, combine phonetic alphabets with **prosody tags** (e.g., `<prosody pitch="high">`). Let me know if you'd like help with a specific TTS engine!


To run `uv run python app.py` as a **persistent service** (auto-start on boot and keep running), follow these steps for Linux systems (Ubuntu/Debian):

---

### **Option 1: Systemd Service (Recommended for Production)**
#### **1. Create a systemd Service File**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kokoro-tts.service
```

Paste this (adjust paths and user):
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Kokoro TTS Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_username  # Replace with your username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/app  # Where app.py lives
ExecStart=/usr/bin/uv run python app.py  # Full path to `uv`
Restart=always  # Auto-restart if crashed
RestartSec=10
Environment="PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### **2. Enable & Start the Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable kokoro-tts.service  # Start on boot
sudo systemctl start kokoro-tts.service   # Start now
```

#### **3. Check Status**
```bash
sudo systemctl status kokoro-tts.service
# Logs: `journalctl -u kokoro-tts.service -f`
```

---

### **Option 2: PM2 (Node.js Process Manager)**
If you prefer a non-root solution:
```bash
npm install pm2 -g  # Install PM2
pm2 start "uv run python app.py" --name kokoro-tts
pm2 save  # Save process list
pm2 startup  # Auto-start on boot (follow the printed instructions)
```

---

### **Option 3: Screen/Tmux (Manual)**
For quick testing:
```bash
sudo apt install screen -y  # Install screen
screen -S kokoro-tts -d -m uv run python app.py
# Detach with Ctrl+A+D, reattach with `screen -r kokoro-tts`
```

---

### **Key Notes**
- **Logs**: For systemd, use `journalctl -u kokoro-tts.service -f`.
- **Debugging**: Test with `ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c "uv run python app.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/kokoro-tts.log"` to capture logs.
- **Permissions**: Ensure your user has execute rights on `app.py` and dependencies.

For **Windows**, use `nssm` (Non-Sucking Service Manager) to wrap the command as a service. Let me know if you need OS-specific tweaks!
