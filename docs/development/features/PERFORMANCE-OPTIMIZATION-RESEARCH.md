Performance Analysis & Optimization Recommendations
Based on my audit of your codebase, here are the key areas where you can potentially improve performance beyond your current 0.9 RTF:

üéØ Current Setup Analysis
Current Model: You're using q4 (4-bit) quantization
Current RTF: 0.81-1.2 (averaging 0.9)
Previous RTF: ~2.0 with fp16
Available Models: You have multiple quantization levels available
üöÄ Immediate Optimization Opportunities
1. Model Selection Optimization
Your config shows model_q8f16.onnx as the TTS model path, but you mentioned using q4. Let's verify the optimal model:

Recommendation: Try model_q4f16.onnx instead of model_q4.onnx

The q4f16 variant keeps weights at 4-bit but maintains float16 activations
This often provides better quality than pure q4 with similar performance
Your benchmark system can test all variants systematically
2. Memory & Caching Optimizations
Your caching system is sophisticated but could be tuned:

# Current cache config in config.json

"cache": {
  "memory_cache_size_mb": 256,
  "audio_memory_cache_mb": 256,
  "text_cache_ttl": 86400
}
Recommendations:

Increase audio memory cache to 512MB if you have RAM available
Enable intelligent preloading for your most common phrases
The preloader system is already implemented but may need tuning
3. Text Preprocessing Optimizations
Your preprocessing is quite comprehensive, but there are opportunities:

# Current preprocessing in config.json
"performance": {
  "expand_contractions": true,
  "preserve_natural_speech": false,
  "max_retry_attempts": 5
}
Recommendations:

Reduce max_retry_attempts from 5 to 2-3 for faster failure handling
Set preserve_natural_speech: true to reduce preprocessing overhead
Consider caching phonemizer results for repeated text patterns
4. ONNX Runtime Optimizations
Your patches.py shows good ONNX optimizations, but you can add more:

Recommendations:

Enable ONNX Runtime graph optimizations
Use session options for better CPU utilization
Consider enabling parallel execution
5. System-Level Optimizations
CPU Affinity & Threading:

# Add to your startup
import os
os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = "4"  # Adjust based on your CPU cores
os.environ["ONNX_DISABLE_SPARSE_TENSORS"] = "1"
Memory Management:

Your current monitoring shows ~44MB RSS usage, which is excellent
Consider enabling memory mapping for model files
Use mlock() to keep critical model data in RAM
6. Batch Processing Optimization
Your current implementation processes requests individually. For better throughput:

Recommendations:

Implement request batching for similar voice/speed combinations
Add request queuing with priority (short texts first)
Consider voice-specific model loading
7. Hardware-Specific Optimizations
For VPS environments:

Check if your VPS supports AVX2/AVX512 instructions
Verify CPU governor is set to "performance" mode
Consider CPU pinning for the main process
üîß Specific Code Changes to Try
A. Enhanced ONNX Session Configuration
Add this to your model initialization:

# In kokoro/patches.py or model loading
import onnxruntime as ort

session_options = ort.SessionOptions()
session_options.graph_optimization_level = ort.GraphOptimizationLevel.ORT_ENABLE_ALL
session_options.execution_mode = ort.ExecutionMode.ORT_PARALLEL
session_options.inter_op_num_threads = 2  # Adjust based on CPU cores
session_options.intra_op_num_threads = 4  # Adjust based on CPU cores

# Use these options when creating the ONNX session
B. Optimized Text Preprocessing
# Add to performance config
"performance": {
  "aggressive_caching": true,
  "phoneme_cache_size": 1000,
  "skip_redundant_processing": true
}
C. Model Warm-up Optimization
Your preloader is good, but you can optimize it:

# Warm up with shorter, common phrases first
WARMUP_PHRASES = [
    "Hello", "Yes", "No", "Thank you", "Please",
    "Good morning", "How are you?", "I understand"
]
üìä Benchmarking Strategy
Your benchmark system is excellent. Run this to find the optimal model:

# Test all models systematically
python kokoro/benchmark.py

# Focus on q4 variants
python kokoro/benchmark.py --models "model_q4*.onnx"
üéØ Expected Performance Gains
Based on the optimizations above, you could potentially achieve:

Model optimization: 10-15% RTF improvement
ONNX Runtime tuning: 5-10% improvement
Preprocessing optimization: 5-8% improvement
Caching improvements: 20-30% for repeated content
System tuning: 5-10% improvement
Target RTF: 0.6-0.7 (down from 0.9) - approximately 25-30% improvement

üö® Quick Wins to Try First
Switch to model_q4f16.onnx - Test this immediately
Increase audio cache to 512MB - Edit config.json
Reduce retry attempts to 2 - Edit config.json
Enable CPU performance governor - System level
Run the benchmark - Identify the fastest model variant
üîç Monitoring & Validation
Your performance monitoring system is excellent. Use the dashboard at /dashboard to:

Track RTF improvements in real-time
Monitor cache hit rates
Validate memory usage stays reasonable
Compare before/after metrics
