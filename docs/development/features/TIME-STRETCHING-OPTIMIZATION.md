## Configuration

Current production settings in `config.json`:
```json
"time_stretching_optimization": {
  "enabled": true,
  "compress_playback_rate": 30,
  "correction_quality": "medium",
  "max_rate": 100,
  "min_rate": 10,
  "auto_enable_threshold": 50,
  "quality_fallback": true,
  "benchmark_mode": false
}
```

## Performance Results

### Benchmark Summary
Comprehensive testing across 4 text categories with 5 iterations each:

| Category | Optimal Rate | RTF Improvement | Quality Score | Duration Error |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Short Text (10 words) | 30% | 42.4% | 1.00 | 0.00% |
| Medium Text (25 words) | 30% | 42.6% | 1.00 | 0.00% |
| Long Text (50 words) | 30% | 42.7% | 1.00 | 0.00% |
| Complex Pronunciation | 30% | 42.6% | 1.00 | 0.00% |

### Quality Thresholds Established
- **Excellent quality:** â‰¥0.9 (rates 10-30%)
- **Good quality:** â‰¥0.8 (rates 40-50%)
- **Acceptable quality:** â‰¥0.7 (rates 60-70%)
- **Poor quality:** <0.7 (rates 80-100%)

### Production Recommendations
- **Default rate:** 30% compression for optimal balance
- **Conservative rate:** 20% for maximum quality assurance
- **Aggressive rate:** 50% for maximum performance (slight quality trade-off)
- **Processing overhead:** <1% of total generation time
- **Memory impact:** Negligible, no memory leaks detected

## API Usage

### HTTP API Parameters

The time-stretching feature is accessible through the `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint:

```json
{
  "input": "Your text to synthesize",
  "voice": "af_heart",
  "time_stretching_enabled": true,
  "time_stretching_rate": 30,
  "time_stretching_quality": "medium"
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `time_stretching_enabled` (boolean): Enable/disable time-stretching for this request
- `time_stretching_rate` (integer, 10-100): Compression rate percentage
- `time_stretching_quality` (string): "low", "medium", or "high" (medium recommended)

### Python API Usage

```python
from kokoro.audio.time_stretcher import TimeStretcher, TimeStretchConfig, StretchQuality

# Create configuration
config = TimeStretchConfig(
    enabled=True,
    compress_playback_rate=30,
    correction_quality=StretchQuality.MEDIUM
)

# Initialize time-stretcher
stretcher = TimeStretcher(config)

# Get speed multiplier
speed_mult = stretcher.get_generation_speed_multiplier()  # Returns 1.3

# Apply time-stretching correction
corrected_audio, metrics = stretcher.stretch_audio_to_normal_speed(
    fast_audio, speed_mult
)
```

## Dependencies

### Required Libraries
- `librosa>=0.8.0` - Essential for medium-quality time-stretching
- `soundfile>=0.10.0` - Audio I/O operations
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - Numerical operations

### Optional Libraries
- `pyrubberband>=0.3.0` - High-quality time-stretching (requires rubberband-cli)

### Installation
```bash
# Install required dependencies
uv add librosa>=0.8.0 soundfile>=0.10.0

# Optional: Install pyrubberband for high-quality mode
sudo apt install rubberband-cli  # Ubuntu/Debian
uv add pyrubberband>=0.3.0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No time-stretching libraries available" Warning**
```
Solution: Install librosa
uv add librosa>=0.8.0
```

**2. "pyrubberband test failed: Failed to execute rubberband"**
```
Solution: Install system rubberband-cli
sudo apt install rubberband-cli  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install rubberband          # macOS
```

**3. Speed multiplier returns 1.0 (no acceleration)**
```
Check: TimeStretcher initialization
- Verify enabled=True in configuration
- Check that librosa is properly installed
- Review logs for library detection messages
```

**4. Poor audio quality at high compression rates**
```
Solution: Reduce compression rate
- Use 30% or lower for production
- Enable quality_fallback in configuration
- Consider using "high" quality mode if pyrubberband is available
```

**5. Processing overhead too high**
```
Optimization:
- Ensure librosa is using optimized BLAS libraries
- Consider reducing compression rate
- Monitor memory usage during processing
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics to ensure optimal performance:
- **RTF Improvement:** Should be >15% for meaningful benefit
- **Duration Error:** Should be <1% for accurate timing
- **Processing Overhead:** Should be <10% of generation time
- **Quality Score:** Should be â‰¥0.8 for production use

### Debug Mode

Enable benchmark mode for detailed metrics:
```json
"time_stretching_optimization": {
  "benchmark_mode": true
}
```

This provides detailed timing and quality metrics in the logs.

## Example Workflow
```python
# Pseudocode for testing
for rate in [10, 20, ..., 100]:
    # Generate TTS at 1.2x speed (for rate=20)
    audio_fast = tts.generate(text, speed=1 + rate/100)

    # Slow down to 1.0x speed
    audio_corrected = time_stretch(audio_fast, correction='medium')

    # Save and log metrics
    save(f"./samples/time-stretched/raw_{rate}%.wav", audio_fast)
    save(f"./samples/time-stretched/corrected_{rate}%.wav", audio_corrected)
    log_benchmarks(rate, audio_fast, audio_corrected)
```

### **Deliverables**
1. **Benchmark Data:** CSV/table comparing all rates.
2. **Audio Samples:**
   - `./samples/time-stretched/raw_10p.wav` â†’ `raw_100p.mp3`
   - `./samples/time-stretched/corrected_10p.wav` â†’ `corrected_100p.wav`
3. **Summary Report:**
   - "Best" rate based on quality/latency trade-off.
   - Recommendation for whether to enable the feature.



## **Research Planning**

# Research:
Your idea is interesting and worth exploring! Let's break it down to understand the potential benefits and drawbacks:

### **Potential Benefits:**
1. **Reduced Perceived Latency:** By generating audio faster (1.2x speed) and then slowing it down during playback, you could indeed improve the **Real-Time Factor (RTF)**â€”meaning the system generates speech faster than real-time, reducing the wait before playback starts.
2. **User Experience Improvement:** If the slowdown is subtle (e.g., 20%), users might perceive the system as more responsive, even if the total time to generate and play remains similar.

### **Potential Drawbacks & Challenges:**
1. **Audio Artifacts & Quality Issues:**
   - **Pitch & Formant Distortion:** Simply slowing down audio (without pitch correction) will lower the pitch, potentially making the voice sound unnatural.
   - **Time-Stretching Artifacts:** Algorithms like **Phase Vocoding** or **WSOLA** (Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add) can mitigate this, but they may introduce slight artifacts (e.g., reverberation, robotic effects).
   - **Voice Clarity:** Aggressive time-stretching (>20%) might degrade intelligibility.

2. **Does It Actually Improve Performance?**
   - **Compute Overhead:** Time-stretching (especially high-quality) requires extra processing, which could offset some of the gains.
   - **RTF vs. End-to-End Latency:** If the TTS model itself is the bottleneck (not post-processing), speeding up generation by 20% might not be feasible without sacrificing quality (e.g., by reducing model steps or using a smaller model).
   - **Buffering Constraints:** If the system streams TTS in chunks, speeding up generation may not help if the next chunk isn't ready yet.

### **When Could This Work?**
- If the TTS model can generate slightly faster (e.g., via optimizations like **speculative decoding, quantization, or a smaller model**) without major quality loss.
- If the slowdown is **mild (â‰¤20%)** and high-quality time-stretching is used (e.g., **PyRubberband, SoundTouch, or RAVE**).
- If **perceived latency** (time until first audio plays) matters more than total generation time.

### **Alternatives to Consider:**
1. **Streaming TTS:** Output audio in chunks as itâ€™s generated (instead of waiting for full synthesis).
2. **Model Optimization:** Use a faster but still high-quality TTS model (e.g., **VITS2, FastSpeech2**).
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Generate the first chunk at 1.2x speed (for quick start) and then normalize speed for the rest.

### **Conclusion:**
Your idea is **realistic but nuanced**â€”it could work **if**:
- The TTS system can generate slightly faster without quality loss.
- The slowdown is subtle (â‰¤20%) and high-quality time-stretching is used.
- The trade-off between **latency improvement** and **audio quality** is acceptable for your use case.

**Recommendation:** Try a small-scale experiment (e.g., 1.1x generation speed + 10% slowdown) and evaluate:
- Does RTF actually improve?
- Is the audio quality still acceptable?
- Does perceived latency feel better?

If results are promising, you could fine-tune the approach further! ðŸš€

Lets impliment this but turn it into an optional performance flag (beta feature, not recommended.. without testing).
'compress_playback': 'enabled',
'compress_playback_rate': 20, # 0-100% (max +100 for 2x speed)
'compress_playback_correction': 'medium',  # low, medium, high

Then generate me 10 audio tests, with benchmarks such as RTF, latency, total time generation, etc. for each 10% increment in audio time-streaching (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% aka. 2x) to determine the optimal rate and if it's "worth it". Then re-stretch out the audio and put in ./samples/time-streched/ for me to review. I can then analyze if the time-stretching method causes quality loss or artifacts, etc.
