Create a modern SaaS website to an AI startup specializing in open source projects but also the development of a full suite of commercial applications geared towards productivity. Use Vite + React + TS with PWA support and the ability to deploy to Cloudflare workers and pages.

**Project:** Create the initial MVP landing page for TaskWizer.

**Objective:** A modern, professional, and conversion-focused website to introduce TaskWizer, generate interest, capture leads, and direct traffic to our open-source repositories.

**Core Brand Messaging:**
*   **Headline/Tagline:** "The AI-Powered Productivity OS. Smarter Tasks, Less Work."
*   **Elevator Pitch:** "TaskWizer is a suite of open-source, AI-native tools designed to work seamlessly together. We're building a composable productivity operating system for the modern developer and team, starting with powerful components like LiteTTS."
*   **Key Value Propositions:** Open Source, Privacy-Focused (Offline-First PWA), Deeply Integrated, Developer-Centric.

**Technical Stack & Requirements:**
*   **Framework:** Vite + React 18 + TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, modern UI development. Use a clean, professional color scheme (consider deep blues, teals, or purples for "AI/produtivity", with a bold accent color for CTAs).
*   **PWA:** Must be a installable Progressive Web App (offline functionality is a key selling point).
*   **Deployment:** Code must be structured and configured for easy deployment to Cloudflare Pages.
*   **Components:** Create reusable, clean React components.
