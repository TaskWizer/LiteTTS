you didn't cleanup anything, the line count is larger!!!!!  104418 total

Expand "watermarking" as it's on dedicated section in the config.json with more options, such as adding a digital signature:
    "watermarking_enabled": false,
    "watermark_strength": 1.0,
    "watermark_detection_enabled": true,
    "use_dummy_watermarker": true,
And move the section to "beta" features.

I signed up for a free Rime AI account so you can use it for testing and validation of the system, please use the API Key:
XY2jMbMiZPpIzbSojtNT4BmJoqB893nsJ2op0OFiH6k

And get the system fully setup to use it.

I would like an end to end audit where you systematically enhance and improve the system to be better (or as least as good as Rime AI).

For example, Rime AI boasts:
Unmatched Realism: "Arcana provides ultra-realistic, multi-lingual voices that laugh, breathe, and sound genuinely human, capturing the warmth, rhythm, and subtle imperfections of real speech. Ideal for creative and business use cases that demand authenticity." (biggest area of improvement)
Speed and Customizability: "Mist v2 delivers unmatched accuracy, speed, and customization at scale. Our precise voices help you convert prospects, retain customers, and drive sales with messages that resonate. Ideal for high-volume, business-critical applications."
Fast and Easy: "Sub-200ms latency (sub-100ms on-prem). Perfect pronunciation. Multi-lingual (English, Spanish, and more). Developer-friendly API." (ours is close but could be improved)
Painless Setup: "Pronounce tricky brand names. Read currencies and lists. Spell out emails and IDs. Deploy anywhere (cloud, VPC, or on-prem). Use websockets. Adjust sampling rate and audio format (mp3, wav, pcm, or mulaw). Handle millions of concurrent conversations." (ours is already super simple to setup).


PAGES DO NOT FUCKING WORK!!!! FIX THIS SHIT:
/static/examples/
/static/examples/voice-cloning

CREATE A FUCKING LANDING PAGE FOR THE FUCKING EXAMPLE AND THEM FUCKING WORKING!!!!

I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PUT IN "index.html" to make a fucking directory work... this is not how a webserver usually works!!!



Critical: Audio is not working in OpenWebUI. It tries to speak, says one sylable "one" and stops for "Once upon a time...". Fix this now.

Maybe use strict linting to find the code not actually being used (this is how it works in JS but I'm not sure about Python).

Continue the task list systematically until all are completed.
Build a plan of action along with a comprehensive task list and work through it systematically until all tasks are completed.

The system is working well overall, however there are some areas of improvement
Prosody and intonation (largest area of improvement), emotion and exageration Phoneme Accuracy, and Context and meaning
And while "contractions" are good for "he's" or "she's" it's prounounces "he'd" as "head" and "she'd" as "shed"



Fix the warning:
Failed to load configuration: AudioConfig.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device'

In OpenWebUI I'm not hearing the audio output but I can see it generated in the terminal... Might be my device but audio seems to be working for everything else, so idk.
Continue the task list systematically until all are completed.
Build a plan of action along with a comprehensive task list and work through it systematically until all tasks are completed.




Move config.json to ./config/settings.json (aka. update name "settings.json") and update all references (as well as docs).
Make sure to update everything to look for ./config/override.json in the same directory.
Move ./docs/voices/README.md to ./docs/VOICES.md and update references (no point to have an entire folder for one file, plus it being a "README.md" is maybe slightly misleading).

Please add `if __name__ == "__main__"` logic to all import scripts with a note that they are not intended to be ran directly.



Change the license from MIT to be Apache 2.0.
Move ./docs/benchmarking/MODEL_BENCHMARKING.md to ./docs/BENCHMARKING.md since there is only one file in the folder and enhance it to include all benchmarking details, etc.
Move ./docs/reports and ./docs/research to ./docs/development (and merge "research" as needed)



Add a disclaimer that this is an alpha software release and still a work in progress, to the top of the README.md file. While the TTS works and performs well, you may experience bugs and that certain advanced features have not been entirely flushed out (such as puncutiation, contractions, porosity, currency, exageration, emotional, voice fluidity, and inflection controls/rules).
Use RIME AI (see API Key) to audit the quality of the output and systematically improve the TTS system, testing the voice system end-to-end:
XY2jMbMiZPpIzbSojtNT4BmJoqB893nsJ2op0OFiH6k
The API gives you access to only 10K context total per month, so be deliberate and concise in your testing/validation.
The README.md still references the "config.json" but should be updated with the "./config/settings.json" reference.
Please audit the system and validate that this (config.json) and previous "Kokoro" references have been updated.
Also, this should not be static "model_path": "LiteTTS/models/model_q4.onnx", (make dynamic based on the model selected)


The command `docker compose up -d` seems to be stuck on "#12 16.06   Getting requirements to build editable: started"
Please audit and fix as I would like to test this docker deployment fully. Default setup should configure and integrate LiteTTS with OpenWebUI and Milvus.
No need to use redis, portainer, prometheus, nginx, or grafana by default. Keep in mind, I have found that the OpenWebUI docker instance requires the use of the full `https://{IPv4}:{port}` address (https://localhost:8354, https://127.0.0.1:8354, or https://host.docker.internal:8354 did not work).

Online docs say this may be a configuration issue, see:
Network Configuration in Docker:
    Ensure the Open WebUI Docker container is configured to use the host's network. This can be achieved by adding the --network=host flag to your docker run command when launching the Open WebUI container. This directly links the container to the host's network, allowing it to access services on the host as if it were running directly on the host.
    If Ollama is running on the host machine and listening on 0.0.0.0, the connection URL in Open WebUI should reference the host's IP address or host.docker.internal (if supported by your Docker setup and configured correctly) along with the correct Ollama port (defaulting to 11434). For example, http://host.docker.internal:11434 (LiteTTS for TTS in this case?)



The docker build takes too long and I believe this is because of all the images being downloaded. Comment them out and allow the user to enable them optionally. No need to download all that if not being used. If there is a "better" way to disable/enable them, please do that.
Also, maybe whatever is being installed with docker is waiting for a prompt (such as waiting for -y or /y to agree to terms?)
And my download speed is fast (1gb/s), so change the timeout to 300 seconds max (should finish in that time).

Also, the local system uses UV, which might be a better choice as it's also faster. Also, copying is NOT the best approach because the user may not want to set it up outside of docker, seems redundant and unnessary.

 2 warnings found (use docker --debug to expand):
 - UndefinedVar: Usage of undefined variable '$OMP_NUM_THREADS' (line 87)
 - JSONArgsRecommended: JSON arguments recommended for CMD to prevent unintended behavior related to OS signals (line 161)


I want TLS to be setup by default (certificate created and setup, etc). Also docker performance seems slow. Can you confirm that the settings.json config defaults are being used? Such as the mode "model_q4.onnx". RTF is above 1 (while if running with `uv run python app.py` it's around 0.2 to 0.25).
Include what the model and default voice being used is set to at the root LiteTTS endpoint
Change the container name from "litetts-litetts" to "litetts-container"
And I'm guessing this is because the docker image copied files rather than a clean "install" but why are there several model images?
e.g. `model_q4.onnx  model_q4f16.onnx  model_uint8f16.onnx`
Make this cleaner and download the files so their are not weird artifacts or issues if a user does not "install" the requirements locally.

Make the "dashboard" fully mobile responsive and enhance it (make it look nicer, flush out features, add to, etc.)

LiteTTS is for voice TTS, not the "OpenAI API" endpoint.
This should be added to the "Text-to-Speech Engine" options and TTS Voice updated to "af_heart"
Get the OpenWebUI working on both TLS port 443 if available and the default OpenWebUI 3000 port.

Can we set STT Settings?

Settings
  STT Settings
    "Instant Auto-Send After Voice Transcription" to "on"
  TTS Settings
    "Auto-playback response" to "on"
    "Set Voice" to "af_heart" (optional)
Admin Settings
  Speech-to-Text
    "Speech-to-Text Engine" to "Whisper (Local)"
    "STT Model" to "turbo"
  Text-to-Speech
    "API Base URL" to "http://localhost:8354/v1"
    "API Key" to "not-needed"
    "TTS Voice" to "af_heart"
    "TTS Model" to "LiteTTS" or "tts-1" (default)?



Please improve the docker setup to use nginx and Milvus with OpenWebUI (by default) to enhance it's usability.
Add "Download" button, and "Playback Speed" (for generation) options to "Real-time TTS Testing" on the Dashboard.
Look into error "Failed to load dashboard data" (but the audio generation still worked)
Fix console error: "ValueError: Out of range float values are not JSON compliant: inf"
The dashboard is still not mobile responsive, please improve this as well as the look and feel.

OpenWebUI Audit
- Disable Ollama API by default
- "http://litetts:8354/v1"

TODO:
Create a new task list to audit system and capabilities using Rime AI and validate everything.
If you hit limits, that's fine... we will test more tommorrow and the next day, etc.

Q&A:
Do the general "Audio" settings need to be modified?
Set the name to take either "LiteTTS" or "tts-1" (OpenWebUI default)?
http://host.docker.internal:11434

Notes:
- Read things like $0.53 as 53 cents? This might cause issues with other currencies.
- Use a "mini-patch" method to add upstream features and changes to OpenWebUI without having to maintain a full distribution.
