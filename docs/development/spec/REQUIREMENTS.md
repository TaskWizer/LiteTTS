## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive Kokoro ONNX TTS API service that provides lightweight, real-time text-to-speech capabilities with advanced linguistic features, emotion control, and seamless integration options. The system will serve as a production-ready API wrapper for the Kokoro TTS ONNX runtime, optimized for low latency (sub-100ms), minimal resource usage (under 100MB), and professional-grade voice synthesis with human-like conversational capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core TTS API Service

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a lightweight TTS API service that can convert text to speech with multiple voice options and emotion control, so that I can integrate high-quality voice synthesis into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a POST request to `/v1/audio/speech` with text input THEN the system SHALL return high-quality audio in the requested format (MP3, WAV, OGG)
2. WHEN a user specifies a voice parameter THEN the system SHALL use the corresponding voice model from the available options (af_heart, am_puck, af_alloy, af_aoede, af_bella, af_jessica, af_nicole, af_sky, am_liam)
3. WHEN a user specifies emotion parameters THEN the system SHALL apply emotion weighting to modify the prosody (neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised)
4. WHEN a user specifies speed control THEN the system SHALL adjust the speaking rate between 0.5x and 2.0x
5. WHEN the system processes text THEN it SHALL achieve sub-100ms latency for typical requests on the same machine
6. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL consume less than 100MB of total resources

### Requirement 2: Advanced Linguistic Processing

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want advanced text normalization and pronunciation control, so that my TTS output sounds natural and handles complex text correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains numbers, dates, or currency THEN the system SHALL normalize them according to linguistic rules (e.g., "2024" â†’ "twenty twenty-four", "$7.95" â†’ "seven dollars, ninety five cents")
2. WHEN text contains abbreviations or acronyms THEN the system SHALL pronounce them correctly based on context (e.g., "Dr." â†’ "Doctor", "NASA" â†’ "Nasa", "DNA" â†’ "D N A")
3. WHEN text contains homographs with disambiguation markers THEN the system SHALL use the specified pronunciation (e.g., "produce_noun" vs "produce_verb")
4. WHEN text contains custom pronunciation markers THEN the system SHALL use the phonetic specification (e.g., "{g1orby0ul2Ets}" for made-up words)
5. WHEN text contains spell() function calls THEN the system SHALL spell out the enclosed content with natural pauses (e.g., "spell(jonathan)" â†’ "J O N, A T H, A N")
6. WHEN text contains punctuation variations THEN the system SHALL adjust prosody accordingly (e.g., "what do you mean?" vs "what do you mean?!")

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization and Streaming

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized audio processing with streaming capabilities, so that the service can handle concurrent requests efficiently with minimal latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text exceeds the chunk size threshold THEN the system SHALL process it in chunks and concatenate the results seamlessly
2. WHEN audio is generated THEN the system SHALL stream the response to reduce perceived latency
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL pre-load all voice embeddings to eliminate loading delays
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL cache common words and phrases to improve response times
5. WHEN multiple requests are received THEN the system SHALL handle them concurrently without blocking
6. WHEN audio format is requested THEN the system SHALL optimize encoding for the best balance of quality and file size

### Requirement 4: OpenAI-Compatible API Schema

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want an OpenAI-compatible interface with comprehensive documentation, so that I can easily integrate the service with existing tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is accessed THEN it SHALL provide OpenAI-compatible endpoints and request/response formats
2. WHEN a user accesses the API documentation THEN the system SHALL serve interactive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
3. WHEN a user makes requests THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL return standardized HTTP status codes and error responses
5. WHEN a user queries available options THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to list voices, emotions, and capabilities
6. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring

### Requirement 5: Docker and Deployment Support

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerized deployment options with comprehensive setup documentation, so that I can easily deploy and manage the service in various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying with Docker THEN the system SHALL provide a complete Docker configuration with all dependencies
2. WHEN using Docker Compose THEN the system SHALL include configuration for easy sandbox deployment
3. WHEN deploying natively THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions for Python/pip and UV setups
4. WHEN integrating with OpenWebUI THEN the system SHALL provide out-of-the-box configuration and setup scripts
5. WHEN deploying to cloud platforms THEN the system SHALL support deployment to services like Cloudflare Workers/Pages
6. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL automatically download required model files if not present

### Requirement 6: Voice Management and Model Handling

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want efficient voice model management with selective downloading, so that I can optimize storage and startup time while maintaining voice quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL pre-download only the essential voice models (af_heart and am_puck)
2. WHEN a user requests a non-preloaded voice THEN the system SHALL download and cache the voice model on-demand
3. WHEN voice models are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate their integrity and compatibility
4. WHEN the system manages voices THEN it SHALL provide metadata including gender, accent, voice type, and quality ratings
5. WHEN users query voices THEN the system SHALL support filtering by category, gender, language, and other attributes
6. WHEN voice files are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and provide fallback options

### Requirement 7: Human-like Conversational Features

**User Story:** As a conversational AI developer, I want human-like speech imperfections and dynamic prosody control, so that I can create more natural and engaging voice interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains filler words THEN the system SHALL render them naturally (e.g., "um", "uh", "huh")
2. WHEN text contains laughter tokens THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate laughter sounds (e.g., "<laugh>")
3. WHEN text contains breathing markers THEN the system SHALL include natural breathing sounds
4. WHEN text contains false starts THEN the system SHALL handle them realistically (e.g., "i- i think")
