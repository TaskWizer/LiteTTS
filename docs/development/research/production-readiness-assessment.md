**Assessment Date:** 2025-08-18  
**Project Version:** 1.0.0  
**Assessment Phase:** Phase 1 - System Audit & Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive assessment evaluates the current state of the Kokoro ONNX TTS API project for production deployment readiness. The analysis reveals a generally well-structured codebase with advanced features, but several critical issues that must be addressed before production deployment.

### Overall Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES CRITICAL FIXES**

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **Strengths**: Comprehensive feature set, good architecture, extensive configuration options
- ‚ùå **Critical Issues**: Model loading discrepancy, configuration hierarchy gaps, incomplete feature implementations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moderate Issues**: Documentation gaps, testing coverage, performance optimization opportunities

## üîç Phase 1: Current State Assessment

### 1.1 Critical System Issues Identified

#### **‚úÖ RESOLVED: Model Loading Discrepancy**
**Issue:** Configuration mismatch between config.json and code defaults
- **Previous State:** config.json specified `"model_q4.onnx"` but code used `"model_fp16.onnx"`
- **Resolution:** Fixed all hardcoded model variants in `kokoro/config.py`, `kokoro/models/manager.py`
- **Current State:** System now correctly uses `model_q4.onnx` as specified in configuration
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Model loading now works correctly

#### **‚úÖ RESOLVED: Configuration Hierarchy Implementation**
**Issue:** override.json precedence system partially implemented
- **Previous State:** Basic override.json loading existed but not fully tested
- **Resolution:** Added missing configuration fields, validated hierarchy works properly
- **Current State:** override.json correctly takes precedence over config.json for all settings
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Configuration hierarchy working properly

#### **‚úÖ RESOLVED: Feature Implementation Assessment**
**Analysis of documented features vs. implementation:**

**Text Processing Pipeline:**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive implementation discovered**: Advanced text processing features are fully implemented
