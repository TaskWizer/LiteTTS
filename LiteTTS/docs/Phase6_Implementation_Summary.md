# Phase 6: Advanced Text Processing and Pronunciation Enhancement

## Implementation Summary

Phase 6 has been successfully implemented to address identified text normalization and homograph disambiguation issues in the LiteTTS system. This comprehensive enhancement improves pronunciation accuracy and naturalness in speech synthesis.

## Completed Components

### 1. Enhanced Number Processor (`enhanced_number_processor.py`)
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

**Key Features:**
- **Comma-separated numbers**: `10,000` → `ten thousand` (not `ten, zero zero zero`)
- **Large numbers**: `1,001` → `one thousand one` (not `one, zero zero one`)
- **Sequential digits**: `1718` → `one seven one eight` when contextually appropriate
- **Context-aware processing**: Model numbers vs years vs phone numbers
- **Currency integration**: Proper handling of monetary amounts
- **Performance optimized**: RTF < 0.25 target maintained

**Critical Fixes Addressed:**
- ✅ Comma-separated number pronunciation
- ✅ Large number natural speech conversion
- ✅ Context-aware sequential digit processing
- ✅ Integration with existing number-to-words systems

### 2. Enhanced Units Processor (`enhanced_units_processor.py`)
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

**Key Features:**
- **Temperature units**: `°F` → `degrees Fahrenheit`, `°C` → `degrees Celsius`, `°K` → `degrees Kelvin`
- **Energy units**: `kWh` → `kilowatt hours`, `MW` → `megawatts`
- **Flight designations**: `Flight no.` → `Flight Number`
- **Speed units**: `mph` → `miles per hour`, `km/h` → `kilometers per hour`
- **Weight/mass units**: `lbs` → `pounds`, `kg` → `kilograms`
- **Volume units**: `L` → `liters`, `gal` → `gallons`
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 50+ unit types supported

**Critical Fixes Addressed:**
- ✅ Temperature unit pronunciation
- ✅ Energy unit expansion
- ✅ Flight designation formatting
- ✅ Comprehensive unit coverage

### 3. Enhanced Homograph Resolver (`enhanced_homograph_resolver.py`)
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

**Key Features:**
- **Critical homograph pairs**: 20+ pairs including lead/wind/tear/desert/resume/wound
- **Context analysis**: Part-of-speech tagging and surrounding word analysis
- **Pronunciation variants**: Multiple pronunciations per homograph
- **Confidence scoring**: Reliability metrics for disambiguation decisions
- **Pattern matching**: Advanced regex patterns for context detection

**Critical Homographs Addressed:**
- ✅ lead: metal `/lɛd/` vs guide `/liːd/`
- ✅ wind: air `/wɪnd/` vs coil `/waɪnd/`
- ✅ tear: cry `/tɪər/` vs rip `/tɛər/`
- ✅ desert: noun `/ˈdɛzərt/` vs abandon `/dɪˈzɜːrt/`
- ✅ resume: CV `/ˈrɛzʊmeɪ/` vs continue `/rɪˈzuːm/`
- ✅ wound: injury `/wuːnd/` vs past tense `/waʊnd/`
- ✅ Plus 14 additional critical pairs

### 4. Phase 6 Contraction Processor (`phase6_contraction_processor.py`)
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

**Key Features:**
- **Ambiguous contraction disambiguation**: He'd/She'd/We'd/I'd (had vs would)
- **Natural pronunciation fixes**: `wasn't` → `wuznt` (not `waaasant`)
- **Context-aware expansion**: Past perfect vs conditional detection
- **Flow improvement**: Enhanced I'm/I'll/you're pronunciation
- **Confidence scoring**: Reliability metrics for disambiguation

**Critical Fixes Addressed:**
- ✅ He'd/She'd/We'd/I'd disambiguation
- ✅ Natural "wasn't" pronunciation
- ✅ Improved contraction flow and intonation
- ✅ Context-aware processing

### 5. Phase 6 Integration (`phase6_text_processor.py`)
