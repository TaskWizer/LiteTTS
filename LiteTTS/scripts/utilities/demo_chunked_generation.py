    Welcome to the demonstration of chunked audio generation! This is a significantly longer piece of text 
    that will showcase how the new chunked generation system provides a much better user experience. 
    Instead of waiting for the entire audio to be generated before hearing anything, you'll start hearing 
    the speech much sooner. This creates a more responsive and real-time feeling interaction. The system 
    intelligently breaks down the text into logical chunks while maintaining voice consistency and natural 
    prosody across all segments. This technology represents a major improvement in text-to-speech user experience.
